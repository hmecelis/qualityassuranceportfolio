# qualityassuranceportfolio
This repository contains documentation about my QA portfolio, both for processes and manual stuff as well as test automation

Hi! My name is Heitor Mecelis and I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer certified by ISTQB (CTFL), I've been working on this area since 2020 and have got experience on Games, ERPs, DDD, BDD and TDD.
Currently I want to have this repository sharing the ideas I've got, and processes that I've developed to improve quality and implement a quality department - both the ones that work and the ones that not so well.
