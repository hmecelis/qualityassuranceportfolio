A functionality sweep is run to find what issues or suggestions are find in an application and is divided in 4 parts:
1 - Mapping
 - the responsible will map the pages and functionalities in it, creating a diagram with the elements present;
2 - Test case creation
 - after mapping the app, the responsible will have data to create the necessary test cases, containing:
    * test case id | action | page link | steps | expected outputs for each step;
3 - Test case execution
 - once the test cases have been created, they will be executed and registered. The table with this info should contain at least:
    * test case id | link to the video | action | expected output | real output | status (pass, not pass, waiting execution, blocked);
4 - Full report
 - last but not least, using the table from the test case execution and the responsible one knowledge, a report regarding the development of 
 the activity shall be create and contain title, which should be where the sweep was done, introduction, which will explain superficially what 
 was done and what the purpose was, statistics, that is a must mostly if you'd like to compare areas of the system and etc, the defects found and 
 how they were dealt with, the conclusion and references;
 
Examples of the files mentioned in this doc will be added to the repository as a way to explain better how and why to use this proccess.

 When and why should I run a Functionality sweep?

 1 - when you've got to get aquainted with the system;
 2 - when there's no QA department and you've got to figure out what direction should the new department go;
 3 - to explore possible issues users may have on a daily basis without waiting for them to report or find anything;
